    <h4>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ</h4>
    <p>This system has been implemented due my inbox being destroyed by an influx of tech support and review requests. Between emails, video comments and unsolicited Facebook messages I could easily do tech support full time, which means no time left to actually make videos. I feel it’s better for me to help many people with a video than to spend significant time trying to help individuals one on one.</p>
    <p>With this in mind, please consider these guidelines before trying to contact me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I don’t offer personal technical support, paid or otherwise, to the general public, Patrons, anyone. Please do not send such requests, you will not receive a reply.</li>
        <li>Feel free to request or suggest a video, but there are several boxes that much be ticked for me to make a video. Just because a topic is important to one person, there is no guarantee it will appeal to or be helpful for a wider audience. If I receive frequent requests from a variety of people on a given topic, the chances of a video increase.</li>
        <li>I don’t do any paid/sponsored videos. This includes manufacturers of channel relevant products making payment or unrelated sponsored segements (VPNs, etc). Independence is key in delivering an unbiased and honest opinion. Products are often provided for free for review/testing and this is communicated in the video and the video description. Any contact offering payment or financial incentive will be ignored.</li>
        <li>I am not interested in joining any partnership programs for ‘influencers’/content creators. I believe in creating the best videos I can and letting the channel grow naturally.</li>
        <li>Please no suggestions/queries related to this website. Please post in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/teachingtechYT/teachingtechYT.github.io/issues" target="_blank">issues</a> section and make sure to read the <a href="https://github.com/teachingtechYT/teachingtechYT.github.io/issues/323" target="_blank">pinned readme</a>.</li>
        <li>In requesting a review, please be aware of my review policy. This document has been created for transparency over time frames and expectations, and to firmly establish my loyalty is to my viewers above all else. <a href="reviewpolicy.html"><b>Review Policy</b></a></li>
        <li>Please try to give concrete details about your product or service. Too often I receive a vague request for a collaboration or review with no actual information. Please link to text/images/video that communicate your product adequately.</li>
        <li>I am much more likely to agree to a review if the product or service is innovative or appeals to a wider audience. Generally, I am not particularly interested in covering a product that is simply a cut price clone of an established product. In my opinion the 3D printer market is already saturated with 'me too' products. See a video on this below:</li>
