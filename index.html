        <p>Welcome to the companion website for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbgBDBrwsikmtoLqtpc59Bw" target="_blank">Teaching Tech YouTube channel</a>.</p>
        <p>Teaching Tech is a YouTube channel dedicated to providing quality content that will help expand your technology related skills and knowledge.</p>
        <p>As a qualified Industrial Designer and Primary/Secondary school teacher, my expertise is very broad. The channel features tutorials on 3D modelling, 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC machining, coding, robotics, electronics and graphic design. I also have other fun tech which I review and feature.</p>
        <p>I pride myself on my integrity and can guarantee only unbiased, unpaid reviews and opinions. The content of my videos is something you can trust to help form your opinion. Finally, I love doing things on a budget. This means I can pass on some great tips that can get you started for minimal outlay.</p>
        <p>This website aims to build on the content provided by my YouTube videos. In some ways it will be more useful than video, which is a one way communication, because I can include interactive content or detailed methodologies. In time this site will be expanded to include more written instructions to compliment videos.</p>
        <p>This site, like the YouTube video descriptions, contain affiliate marketing links. These include affiliate links through Amazon as I am an Amazon Associate. An affiliate link gives me a percentage of the sale price as a commision, with no increase in price for you. It is understandable if you wish not to use them, so please avoid them if you prefer.</p>
        <p>This channel trailer was the first ever video on the channel but proved to be accurate. Although I primarily focus on 3D printing, I have covered everything listed except video editing.</p>
