        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project is a collaboration between myself and the <a href="https://github.com/DraftShift/" target="_blank">DraftShift</a> team, creators of the <a href="https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger" target="_blank">Stealthchanger</a> modification for the <a href="https://vorondesign.com/voron2.4" target="_blank">Voron 2</a>. This is built on the previous work of Viesturz in creating the <a href="https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger" target="_blank">Tapchanger</a>, another toolchanger modification for the Voron 2. DraftShift contacted me and asked if I was interested in adapting their work to the Sovol SV08, a budget clone of the Voron 2. This has been a difficult journey, as I have never built a Voron 2 and therefore didn't understand the inner workings and processes, and the DraftShift team did not have access to an SV08. This was a true collaboration, and not possible with only one side. I am eternally grateful to the DraftShift crew for their patient support and assistance. Many times I was stuck and had silly questions which they always answered patiently. Thank you Chris, Justin, Thomas and all other contributors for their work.</p>
        <h4>Philosophy/Concept</h4>
        <p>The philosophy for this project was to provide a path to convert the SV08 to a toolchanger in the simplest and cheapest way possible. Where possible, any modifications are reversible and systems have been designed to be modular. Therefore the steps are more or less the same if you are adding a second toolhead or enough to have six tools in total.</p>
        <p>There are numerous other options available for other variations of the modifications. There is nothing to stop you mixing and matching components. For example, use the modular spool holder from this project and print an alternate tool shroud from another project to better suit your needs. The simple approach and reliance on factory parts means there will be limitations. If these are an issue for you, feel free to upgrade as you see fit.</p>
        <h4>SV08 Max compatibility</h4>
        <p>I do not have acees to an SV08 Max, but presumably the design is scaled up using very similar parts. It seems likely that the parts from this project could be adapted to the SV08 Max or other Voron 2 variants without too much effort. Source CAD is available for all parts to faciliate this.</p>
        <h4>Discussion and Remixes</h4>
        <p>These instructions are hosted on this site to give the most control over the formating and presentation. However this platform is not well suited to discussion and sharing. Therefore, I have established a <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/1569932-sovol-sv08-toolchanger-project" target="_blank">companion page on Printables</a>. Please use it to add remixed parts or discuss problems and solutions with each other. Realistically, I am now retired from YouTube so will not be able to provide support for questions and queries. I aim to release my contribution with as much detail and flexibility as possible for others to understand it and modify it as needed.</p>
        <p>All required source CAD has been designed in or imported to Onshape. The permissions of the documents are set so you can export any part without having an Onshape account. Just right click on the part itself or on the part name in the lower left of screen then select a format of your choice. All project sections are organised into folders and the relevant documents are linked for each tab.</p>
        <h4>BOM</h4>
        <p>Each tab has a breakdown of hardware, other components and printed parts. The CAD source is available for all parts and is linked accordingly. All printed parts have been oriented correctly and required notes for materials/settings/supports are provided as needed. Since my printer is not enclosed, I used PETG for all parts. Those seeking to enclosure might choose a filament with higher thermal resistance like ASA.</p>
        <p>Many of the steps require a small volume of parts, like crimping connectors. If you are like myself, you already have a crimping tool and spare connectors. If not, links have been provided to sets to suit the purpose. Hopefully you can avoid this expense by using existing tools and parts.</p>
        <p>Please understand that prices and availability for components will change over time. Throughout this project I have kept track of the expected cost for those building the Toolchanger at home. The accuracy of this will diminish over time but hopefully the concept will remain, ensuring these parts are a good combination between usable and affordable.</p>
        <p>The BOM on some tabs will specify a certain type of head or cap for some bolts. Adhering to this is important because button heads bolts are more slimline. Using socket head instead may prevent some parts from assemblng correctly. Where SHCS or BHCS is not specified, either can be used for that step.</p>
        <p>Occasionally a FHCS bolt will be specified, and it is important to adhere to that type in these components.</p>

        <h4>Costs and Affiliate links</h4>
        <p>The initial SV08 and spare tools were provided free of charge by Sovol in support of this project. Since then, I have purchased all components with my own money, at significant cost. To assist in covering these costs, affiliate links may be used throughout each tab's BOM. They will be marked TT or DS to signify whether the income will go to Teaching Tech or DraftShift. Some of these are my own affiliate links and where possible I will maintain existing affiliate links from the DraftShift GitHub.</p>
        <p>The cost of someone building this project will be a lot less than the expenditure outlayed by myself and the DraftShift team. Development requires experimentation and iteration that is hopefully not be present for the end user.</p>
        <h4>Tool Numbering</h4>
        <p>In software, counting starts from the number 0, not 1. Klippe adopts the same approach. Throughout this guide, you will see examples of this system. the 1st tool will be called tool 0, the 2nd tool 1, the 3rd tool 2 and so on. When preparing the firmware config and later running macros from Mainsail, this approach is used.</p>
        <p>In the slicer however, the 1st tool is labelled tool 1 and so on. this can be a little confusing but most people will be able to adapt.</p>
        <h4>Enclosure</h4>
        <p>My own SV08 does not have an enclosure fitted. Sovol offers a factory enclosure option and community enclosures are also available. As initially released, these parts may not be compatible with an enclosure, but it is worth checking remixes on Printables to see if any variations exist that can cater for enclosures.</p>
        <h4>Warranty and Safety Warning</h4>
        <p>This modification process undounbtedly comes with a degree of risk. Your warranty will undoubtedly be void from the changes undertaken.</p>
        <p class="warning">Every effort has been made in these instructions to ensure the parts and modifications made are safe and reliable, however when a large group of people with varying levels of skill and knowledge attempt such modifications, there is every chance that for some users things will go wrong. By following this guide, you do so at your own risk. Teaching Tech and DraftShift take no responsibility for any damage or harm that occurs from attempting this modification.</p>

        <h4>Ordering an SV08</h4>
        <p>Before starting, you need an Sovol SV08 3D printer. This modification is built upon the touch screen variant. This is highly recommended because this adds the KlipperScreen interface to the printer, which is highly customisable and allows easy access to macros.</p>

        <h4>Collecting tool serial IDs for Klipper</h4>
        <p>Before doing anything else, it is imperitive that you collect the serial IDs of each MCU that Klipper will use to connect and communicate. These are the addresses Klipper will use to connect to each of the tools you add. Sovol used an unusual system to name the factory MCUs that does not scale with new tools. We need to retrieve the serial IDs of the mainboard, default tool and any additional tools. I recommend storing them in a text file for later reference. This means disconnecting and connecting the tools frequently.</p>
        <p>When done, your text file with serial IDs should look something like this:</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/prep/serialids.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/prep/serialids.jpg" /></a>
        <p class="warning">It is essential to power down the printer before connecting or disconnecting any of the tools. Failure to do so may damage a tool's electronics, requiring replacement. This includes the JST connectors on the toolhead PCB, the JST connectors on the mainboard and the Birds' Nest USB hub (which will be fitted later) connectors.</p>
        <p>There are multiple methods, but I prefer to retrieve the IDs via SSH in your terminal software of choice. I have a tutorial for how to use Pronterface on the <a href="troubleshooting.html#terminal" target="_blank">troubleshooting</a> page.</p>
        <p>The credentials to login via SSH are as follows. At this stage you should be using the 'As shipped by Sovol' option. Later in the process, the credentials will change, and I include them here for completeness.</p>

        </table>
        <p>We will start by getting the serial ID for the mainboard. With the printer powered down, disconnect the two JST plugs going into the mainboard that lead to the default toolhead.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/prep/mcujsts.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/prep/mcujsts.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Turn the printer on. In the web interface, Klipper will give an error about the tool MCU not being found. This is expected and can be ignored.</p>
        <p>Now connect via SSH and send the following command:</p>
        <pre>ls /dev/serial/by-id*</pre>
        <p>The serial ID for the mainboard will be returned. For example, mine is <i>/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_stm32f103xe_30FFD4053347543034871651-if00</i></p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/prep/ssh1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/prep/ssh1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Copy and paste this into your text file under the heading mainboard.</p>
        <p>Power down the printer, re-connect the JST connectors to the mainboard and power up once more. Connect via SSH and run the same command. This time, two serial IDs will be returned: the mainboard and the default tool. Determine which of these is new/distinct, then copy and paste it to your text file under the heading tool 0. Label tool 0 with a sharpie or tape accordingly.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/prep/ssh2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/prep/ssh2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/prep/label.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/prep/label.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Power down the printer, and this time disconnect the JST plugs from tool 0, before connecting them to the first of your additional tools.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/prep/tooljsts.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/prep/tooljsts.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Connect via SSH and retrieve the serial ID again. The mainboard will again be listed with a new tool serial ID. Copy this to your text file under the heading tool 1. Label tool 1 accordingly.</p>
        <p>Power down the printer, disconnect the current tool, connect the next and repeat the process until you have the serial IDs of all of your tools. Label the physical tools to match.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/prep/serialids.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/prep/serialids.jpg" /></a>
        <p>If you power down the printer and connect back the original tool and power up, any Klipper errors should be gone and the printer should be back to working order.</p>

        <h2>Power Supply Replacement</h2>
        <p>This tab covers upgrading the PSU to handle up to six tools instead of just one.</p>
        <p>The relevant section of the video is here:</p>
        <iframe loading="lazy" width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_FhIQgqC2A?start=267&end=442" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p class="warning">This step requires dealing with mains voltage wiring, which has the potential to kill. This is not for beginners. Please consult a professional before attempting these procedures. Ensure the printer is powered off and the power isolated before touching any items concerning the PSU.</p>
        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>The SV08 has a mains AC powered heated bed, therefore the factory power supply only needs to supply current to the mainboard, one tool and some extras like sensors and LEDs. Consequenmtly it is small and low powered. In order to accommodate up to five additional tools, the PSU needs upgrading to potentially power up to six tools at once.</p>

        <h4>Mounting the larger PSU</h4>
        <p>Prepare the PSU adaptor by placing two M4x8mm bolts and T nuts in the left hand holes.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/psu/adaptor1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/psu/adaptor1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Slide the adaptor into position so that the T nuts go into the 2020 extrusion on the left. Position the adaptor so that the mounting holes line up with those in the underside of the printer. Use the self tapping screws that previously held the old PSU and cover to secure the daptor. Tighten the M4 bolts/T nuts to secure the adaptor to the 2020 extrusion on the left.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/psu/adaptor2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/psu/adaptor2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Slide the new PSU into the adaptor and use four M4x8mm bolts to secure it in place.</p>
        <p class="warning">Bolts longer than 8mm must not be used here as they may extend into the inside of the PSU and create a safety hazard.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/psu/adaptor3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/psu/adaptor3.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Rewiring</h4>
        <p>Install the existing 24V wires from the mainboard into the 24V output terminals of the new PSU.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/psu/wiring1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/psu/wiring1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Disconnect the mains wires from the bed heater board (red, black and yellow/green). Feed the ends of these wires back to the left near where the mains power input is.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/psu/wiring2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/psu/wiring2.jpg" /></a>

        <p>Position the cable near the PSU mains input terminal, and cut off the old spade connectors and strip back the insulation.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/psu/wiring4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/psu/wiring4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>For each of the three mains wires, crimp on new spade connectors to suit the new PSU terminals, but with an approximately 450mm length of new cable daisy chaining off. This new segment will travel up to the bed heater board. Trim the daisy chained wire to suit and crimp on a spade connector. Attach the spade connectors to the terminals of the PSU and bed heater board.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/psu/wiring5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/psu/wiring5.jpg" /></a>

        <h2>Birds' Nest USB Hub</h2>
        <p>This tab covers adding a Bird's Nest USB hub by Isik's Tech. This is a Klipper compatible, easy to use expansion part that allows us to have up to six tools with only power and USB connections back to the mainboard.</p>
        <p>The relevant section of the video is here:</p>
        <iframe loading="lazy" width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_FhIQgqC2A?start=442&end=617" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>The SV08 uses USB connections (instead of CANbus) for its tools. The mainboard has two USB ports plus a JST set of connectors (used by default for tool 0). The webcam uses one USB port, meaning without expansion we would be limited to a two tool build. the Birds' Nest allows up to six tools, whilst only requiring a single USB port. It also have its own Klipper compatible MCU and IO pins, meaning we can add filament runout sensors and other hardware if desired.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/xbst/Birds-Nest/" target="_blank">Birds' Nest GitHub</a></p>
        <p>In part 2 of the original video series, I initially tried a cheap USB hub. This was limited to four tools max and offered none of the other benefits of the Birds' Nest. It is still possible to use something like this but the Birds' Nest is vastly superior.</p>

        <h4>Printed Parts Preparation</h4>
        <p>Six M3 heat sets need to be melted into place. There are four in the extrusion adaptor and two in the fannypack base.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/heatsets1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/heatsets1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/heatsets2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/heatsets2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Eight magnets need to be inserted into the fannypack parts. Four go in each side and the magnets need to be matched so that they attract each other. Depending on how tight the fit is, you may need a small bit of super glue to retain them.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/magnets.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/magnets.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Mounting</h4>
        <p>Secure the Birds' nest board to the fannypack base using two M3 x 8mm bolts. Secure the fannypack base to the extrusion adaptor using four M3 x 8mm bolts.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/mounting1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/mounting1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/mounting2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/mounting2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>At the upper rear left of the frame, remove the two M3 bolts holding the horizontal bar to the corner. Flex the horizontal bar backwards and slide the extrusion adaptor/fannypack base assembly onto the extrusion and into the centre.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/mounting3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/mounting3.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/mounting4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/mounting4.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/mounting5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/mounting5.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Wiring</h4>
        <p>Wiring for the Birds' Nest is very simple. We need to supply 24V and grond, plus a USB cable.</p>
        <p>Cut a length of two core 12awg cable to approximately 1m in length. This may be shortened later on but 1m is a good starting value. On one end, crimp a set of blue spade connectors and secure into the 24V output terminals on the PSU.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The other end recives two ferrule/boot lace connectors suitable for the screw terminals on the Birds' nest board.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>If you ordered the USB-A to USB-C cable with the Birds' Nest, the other half on the wiring is already done. This cable goes between the spar USB-A port on the mainboard to the USB-C port on the Birds' Nest.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring2.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Cable Routing</h4>
        <p>Protect the cables with sheathing or a similar product.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring5.jpg" /></a>
        <p>There is a opening behind the bed where some cables already pass through. A plastic cap that seals this can be removed to faciliate feeding the two Birds' nest cables through. I would recommend Unplugging the cable for tool 0 that already passes through here and separating it from the rest. It can be temporarily routed elsewhere if you are unwilling to take the printer offline. Feed the Birds' Nest cables from below, through this opening, and press the plastic cap back on.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring6.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring7.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring7.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/wiring8.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Birds' Nest Firmware</h4>
        <p>For this section, it's best to refer to the <a href="https://github.com/xbst/Birds-Nest/blob/master/Docs/Birds-Nest-Manual.pdf" target="_blank">Birds' Nest Manual</a> for the most up to date information.</p>
        <p>If you have purchased your board from Isik's Tech, the section on <b>nBOOT_sel</b> can be skipped.</p>
        <p>Klipper firmware must be compiled and installed on the board in any case, however. Follow the steps in the manual to SSH into the pi, compile Klipper using the correct settings for the board, and then flash the firmware. The image below is for reference only, please follow the exact instructions from the manual.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/firmware1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/firmware1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>As we did in the preparation step, we need to collect the serial ID of the Birds' Nest board to add to our text file. SSH in to the pi and run the same command as previously:</p>
        <pre>ls /dev/serial/by-id*</pre>
        <p>Look for an entry that starts with <i>STM32G0B1</i> (all of the previous results started with <i>STM32F103</i>). Copy and paste this to complete your text file.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/birdsnest/firmware2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/birdsnest/firmware2.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Klipper Configuration</h4>
        <p>The Birds' Nest manual outlines steps to download a configuration file as part of your Klipper config. We will skip this step, because the pre-prepared SD card image already has all of the config files in place. Later in the process, we will simply enter our own serial IDs into the config files.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="docks">
        <h2>Modular Docks</h2>
        <p>This tab covers adding a modular dock to the front of the SV08, where the tools not in use are parked. The printed parts were designed by DraftShift as a variation on their <a href="https://github.com/DraftShift/ModularDock" target="_blank">Stealthchanger Modular Dock</a>. This means that if you decide to use a different ttol design, there will hopefully be a dock to suit.</p>
        <p>The relevant section of the video is here:</p>
        <iframe loading="lazy" width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_FhIQgqC2A?start=617&end=969" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>The SV08 is released as a single tool printer. When converted to a toolchanger, additional tools are fitted and need a place to be stored when not in use. This dock connects to an added piece of 2020 extrusion, as well as the existing extrusions at the top of the SV08 frame.</p>
        <p class="warning">Unless you are extremely tight for filament or parts, I would recommend printing and assembling this dock in a six tool configuration, even if you are using five or less tools. This is because the six tools dock fills the entire width of the printer. Not using it will require spacers and other solutions to fill the width. A six tool dock also allows much easier addition of more tools at a later date.</p>
        <p>The SV08 dock is split into three sections. Firstly, the dock bar, which is the common frame that interfaces with the printer. Secondly, the individual docks, of which I recommend you produce six sets. Finally, the links, which are added after the docks and help keep the docks correctly spaced and positioned.</p>

        <h4>Assembly Manual</h4>
        <p>An excellent resource is available for this step of the build in the <a href="https://github.com/DraftShift/ModularDock/blob/main/Manual/ModularDock_Assembly_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">StealthChanger ModularDock Assembly Guide</a>. Although there are some variations in parts to suit the SV08, most of the manual applies and is easy to follow.</p>
        <h4>Printed Parts Preparation</h4>
        <p>The 2020 brackets have two pieces of support structure to remove.</p>
        <p>There are many heat insets to be installed. Four are required for dockbar parts (one in each 2020 bracket and one in each side bracket). There are twenty four heat sets per dock. Most of these are in the assembly manual, but some are less obvious.</p>
        <p>In each dock, there are two in the underside of the base piece:</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/heatset1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/heatset1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Four more heat sets are uses in the face spacer pieces:</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/heatset2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/heatset2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The outer two docks geta pair of heat sets that will later attach to the large brackets of the dock bar.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/heatset3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/heatset3.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Dockbar Installation</h4>
        <p>We will start by installing the majority of the dock bar with the 2020 extrusion piece.</p>
        <p>Remove the factory M3 x 8mm bolts holding the SOVOL branded top frame piece to the printer. Remove this frame piece and then remove the LED bar from it.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/dockbar1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/dockbar1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/dockbar2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/dockbar2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Slide four stabilizer pieces along the front edge of the 2020. These will reduce wobble later. Install the 2020 brackets on the outer edges of the 2020 extrusion. M3 x 12mm bolts can be used in the 2020 brackets to lock them against the extrusion.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/dockbar3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/dockbar3.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/dockbar4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/dockbar4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Insert the 2020 assembly behind the upper SOVOL frame piece of the printer. Use two M3 x 10mm bolts on each side to secure the assembly to the frame. The 2020 which forms the structure for the dock bar is now finished.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/dockbar5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/dockbar5.jpg" /></a>        
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/dockbar6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/dockbar6.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The side brackets attach in the same way. Remove the two factory M3 bolts holding the frame extrusion, place the side bracket over the top and use two M3 x 10mm bolts to hold everything together.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/dockbar7.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/dockbar7.jpg" /></a>        
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/dockbar8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/dockbar8.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Docks Assembly</h4>
        <p>From here, the DratShift manual is the best resource. The BOM above also details where each nut and bolt is used. Simply follow the steps to assemble six docks. This sequence also includes moulding RTV silicone into the blocker cup. Remember to select the two docks which will sit on the far left and far right. These should have previously had heat sets melted into the outer edges.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks3.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks4.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks5.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks6.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Adding Docks to the Dock Bar</h4>
        <p>Install the corner docks first. The large bracket attached to them should line up with the side bracket, with the isolator and rectangular spacer inbetween. An M3 x 25mm bolt in each side secures the parts together.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks7.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks7.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks8.jpg" /></a>
        <p>I recommend temporarily removing the L bracket from the top of each dock, then securing the top of the dock to the underside of the 2020 extrusion with M5 x 10mm bolts and T nuts. Then reattach the L brackets with M5 bolts and T nuts in place. Once everything is tightened each dock should be secure.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks9.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks9.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks10.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks10.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Use the 7mm spacer to assist in installing the centre four docks in the right position. Using two spacers at the same time will help align the top and bottom of each dock.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks11.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks11.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/docks12.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/docks12.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Adding Links</h4>
        <p>The final components are the links. These hold the docks in place with the correct spacing and add rigidity. The SV08 specific guide links also help hold the tools squarely when docked. Four centre links are needed and a bespoke left and right version on the sides. M5 x 10mm bolts go through the bottom frame piece of the dock and go into trappen M5 locknuts in the guide links.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/links1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/links1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/links2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/links2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The rear links install on the underside, with a pair of M3 x 6mm bolts holding each.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/links3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/links3.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/docks/links4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/docks/links4.jpg" /></a>

        <h2>Spool Holder</h2>
        <p>This tab covers upgrading adding a modular spool holder to either the front or back of the printer.</p>
        <p>The relevant section of the video is here:</p>
        <iframe loading="lazy" width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_FhIQgqC2A?start=969&end=1369" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>The SV08 has a single spool holder to suit the single tool. Our toolchanger conversion requires a solution that holds up to six spools for up to six tools.</p>
        <p>Unlike the modular dock, where i recommend building a six dock system in every case, this part of the build can be scaled to suit the number of tools. The underlying frame spans the printer and additional spool holders can be added conveniently at a later time. The frame has enough rigidity regardless of how many spool holders are fitted.</p>
        <h4>BOM</h4>
        <p>The following hardware is required. BOM is divided into common, front mount and rear mount sections.</p>

        <h4>Old spool holder removal</h4>
        <p>Simply unbolt the old holder and unplug the old filament runout sensor too. These are no longer needed. The cable for the runout sensor runs down one the vertical corner extrusions behind a plastic piece. You may wish to remove these to tidy up the appearance of the printer.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/oldspool.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/oldspool.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Prepearing 2020 extrusion</h4>
        <p>Prepare two lengths of 500mm 2020 extrusion. I recycled extrusion from an old 3D printer, cutting it down to length.</p>
        <p>If possible, tap an M5 thread about 10mm into the centre bores of each piece. This will add strength to the assembly but if you don't have the tools, this step can be skipped.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/20201.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/20201.jpg" /></a>

        <h4>Printed parts preparation</h4>
        <p>Each span divider receives a single M3 heat set. Of the two holes, the larger of the two has the heat set melted in.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/heatset1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/heatset1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Each spool needs two rollers, and each roller needs a 608RS bearing hammered in to each end.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/roller.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/roller.jpg" /></a>
        <p>A BTT SFS can be mounted to each sensor mount using the M3 bolts that came in the box.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/sensor1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/sensor1.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Assembling the System</h4>
        <p>Temporarily attach your front/rear brackets to the 2020 extrusion, so that is spans horizontally between them. This will hold the extrusion parallel and still during further assembly.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/assembly1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/assembly1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Starting on one side, push a span bracket to the end of the extrusion, with the bosses for the rollers facing the middle. Now assemble pairs of span brackets with the flats facing each other, and two M3 x 8mm bolts holding the pair together. Place the span brackets in the middle, then slide them to the side, trapping a set of rollers. Repeat this process until you have all span brackets and rollers in place for your desired number of spool holders.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/assembly2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/assembly2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/assembly3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/assembly3.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/assembly4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/assembly4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Turn the assembly upside so you can add M5 x 8mm bolts and T nuts to hold the span brackets to the extrusion. A maximum of four per spool can be used, but also much less to save on parts.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/assembly5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/assembly5.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Also add M5 x 8mm bolts and T nuts to the front/rear brackets and 2020 extrusion, but only do them up loosely. It is important at this stage that the two end brackets can swivel freely.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/assembly6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/assembly6.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Move the assembly into position at either the front or rear of the machine. Lower from above, and then pivot inwards until the two brackets snap into place. Tighten all of the loose M5 bolts and T nuts. Secure the brackets to the frame with M3 x 10mm bolts.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/assembly7.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/assembly7.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/assembly8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/assembly8.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/assembly9.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/assembly9.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Fit the sensor mounts to the front of the extrusion in line with each roller using two M5 x 8mm bolts and T nuts. The sensors will face the front of the machine regardless of whether the system is front or rear mounted.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/assembly10.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/assembly10.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>PTFE Tube</h4>
        <p>Prepare a 900mm length of PTFE tube for each spool holder. One end plugs into the output of the filament sensor. The other end will be loose for now.</p>
        <p>At a later stage, you may wish to shorten the reverse bowden tubes to tidy things up, but don't attempt this yet.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/tube.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/tube.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>SFS Wiring</h4>
        <p>The BigtreeTech SFS V2.0 is unique in that it offers two filament monitoring modes in one. It has microswitch that detects the presence of filament. The printer will know if filament is loaded before the print starts, and then if it runs out during the print.</p>
        <p>This sensor also has an encoder, a electronic components that measures rotation. During printing, a pulse is sent to the firmware for every ~3mm of filament that passes through. In the event of a runout, tangle or jam, the pulse will not be sent and the firmware can pause the print. The downside of this encoder is that it cannot be polled by the firmware to know if filament is present or not. The filament must be moving which means pre-print detection is unavailable.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/bigtreetech/smart-filament-detection-module" target="_blank">BTT SFS V2 GitHub</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/xbst/Birds-Nest/" target="_blank">Birds' Nest GitHub</a></p>
        <p class="warning">There is a small limitation in the Birds' Nest PCB for this sensor. Each SFS requires positive, ground, and a signal pin for the switch and encoder. This means for six tools, to use the switch and encoder functions, twelve signal inputs are required. Twelve ports exist on the Birds' Nest, but the Neopixel ports are configured so that they are output only, not input. That leaves ten input pins available, meaning a five tool or less build can use both SFS functions at once, but a six tool build cannot.</p>
        <p>For this reason I chose to connect only the switch wires, and not the encoder wires. In your build, you may select a different option for SFS configuration. I depinned the connector and separated the green wire (default for encoder). If you wanted to keep only the encoder and not the witch, you would instead remove the blue wire (default for switch). If you want to run both features, do not remove any wires.</p>

        <p>The following diagram shows suggested connections to the Birds' Nest PCB if a five tool build is using both the switch and encoder inputs.</p>

        <p>Use cable ties to secure the SFS cables to the slots on the sensor mount.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/wiring6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/wiring6.jpg" /></a>
        <p>If your have chosen the rear mount option, your wires from the SFS will be quite long and untidy. You may optionally cut and recrimp JST connectors to tidy the wiring up.</p>

        <h2>Umbilicals</h2>
        <p>This tab covers crating umbilicals: the cable and PTFE bundle between the Birds' Nest and individual tools.</p>
        <p>The relevant section of the video is here:</p>
        <iframe loading="lazy" width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_FhIQgqC2A?start=1369&end=1782" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>The standard SV08 has one tool and one umbilical cable with a dedicated clamping system. The PTFE tube feed to the tool is mostly separate from the cable too. To add tools until we have up to six, we need a more robust system to attach each tool and PTFE tube, where they maintain a gentle arc and don't tangle with each other. This design also aims for easy disconnection, where individual tools and unmbilicals can be removed with minimal disassembly (provided the printer is powered down). Due to the addition of the Birds' Nest hub, out cables must have special connectors crimped on to suit compared to the smaller JST connectors used from factory at both ends.</p>
        <h4>Variation</h4>
        <p>There exists multiple options for the cable used here. I selected something that is overengineered for the job. Only the positive and negative wires need to be thick for high current, yet all five cores in my cable are thick, making the cable fairly heavy overall. If you find a five core cable with two thick cores and three thinner cores, there is a variable in the CAD decribed below you can reduce to alter the TPU parts to suit.</p>
        <p>The cable I am using is approximately 8mm in external diameter, which becomes 10mm when protective sheathing is added.</p>

        <h4>Printed Parts Preparation</h4>
        <p>Two M3 heat sets are required per tool in the flat spring birdsnest clamp rear part.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/heatsets.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/heatsets.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Cable</h4>
        <p>Cut the five core cable to approximately 104cm in length. It can be slightly longer as the flat spring will be trimmed to length later on. The following image shows the connectors crimped in place, which will be the next step.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Remove 75mm of insulation from one end of the cable. You can also cut off the metal shielding from this end. The side will connect to the tool PCB.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Crimp JST XH (2.54mm pitch) connectors to the red and black wires. Crimp JST PH (2.00 pitch) to the white, blue and yellow wires.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>If you are using the same cable as me, the JST PH connectors will be quite small in comparison. They can still be crimped on if you are careful. The plastic housing is easier to install if you squish the wires from the side first.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The other end of the cable will connect to the Birds' Nest board. Strip back 40mm of insulation. Do not cut off the metal shielding that wraps around the wires. We will use this for improving the reliability of the USB signal. Gather it in a bunch, and solder approximately 50mm of black wire to it. Cover this in heat shrink to keep it tidy.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable5.jpg" /></a>

        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable7.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable7.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable8.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The Birds' Nest board came with the Molex MX3.0 connectors and housing required for the six wires. Crimp these on and install into the housing as per the diagram.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Repeat until you have a cable per tool. there are two optional but highly recommended steps.</p>
        <p>Apply liquid electrical tape to the backs of the JST connectors. This will keep out dust and debris and provide a tiny amount of strain relief.</p>
        <p>Wrap the cables in protective sheathing to prevent abrasion wear and tear over time. This will also bring the thickness up to 10m to suit the default TPU printed parts. Stop the sheathing just short on the tool end. The clamp at the top of the tool only just fits the thicker cable. Sheathing will make it too thick.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable9.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable9.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable10.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/cable10.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Optional: Inverse tool PCB plug placement</h4>
        <p>The thicker wires don't bend as tightly and therefore touch the back of the part cooling fan on the tool shroud. This makes putting the shroud back on difficult and will strain the JST connectors over time.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/inverse1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/inverse1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>It is possible to move the JST ports on the tool PCB to the rear side to fix this problem.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/inverse2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/inverse2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Remove the factory JST housings with a set of pliers and/o a flat prying tool. Use a soldering iron to heat the factory JST pins from the PCB. Use a solder sucker to remove an remaining solder from he PCB.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/inverse3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/inverse3.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/inverse4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/inverse4.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/inverse5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/inverse5.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Solder the new JST connectors onto the rear side of the PCB. The cutout in the housing previously faced downwards towards the nozzle, but when positioned on the rear of the PCB needs to be flipped so that the cut outs face upwards. Doing this will preserve the correct pinouts for the cable and can be seen in the diagram below.</p>

        <h4>Tool End Preparation</h4>
        <p>Undo the two M3 bolts holding the clamp around the umbilical cable. Slip in the flat spring tool clamp printed piece behind the clamp and use the same M3 bolts to hold the clamp in place.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/toolend1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/toolend1.jpg" /></a>

        <h4>Birds' Nest end preparation</h4>
        <p>Take one of the flat spring coils, unwind it and find the approximate middle. This does not need to be eact as we will be cutting each to length later on. Cut the flat spring in half at this mid point.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/birdsnestend1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/birdsnestend1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/birdsnestend2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/birdsnestend2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Bend around 5mm of the flat spring at one end and push it through the opening in the spring clamp front piece. Attach the two spring clamp pieces together with two M3 x 8mm bolts. The flat spring should be clamped inbetween them. Bend or cut the exposed flat spring end so that it can't later cut the umbilical cable. You may wish to cover it with tape as an extra precaution.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/birdsnestend3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/birdsnestend3.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/birdsnestend4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/birdsnestend4.jpg" /></a>

        <p>The cable will rest inside the groove in these printed pieces, but do not apply the cable ties yet to lock them together.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/birdsnestend6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/birdsnestend6.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>TPU clamps</h4>
        <p>Cut the tool end of the flat spring to trim the corners off. Also use a thin tool like a flathead screwdriver to clear any strings inside the TPU clamp parts.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/clamps1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/clamps1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/clamps2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/clamps2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Feed the TPU clamps to the flat spring from the tool end towards the Birds' Nest end. Each clamp should point upwards from the curve of the spring. Feed on four single clamps first followed by five double clamps.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/clamps3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/clamps3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>You may choose to alternate the orientation of the single clamps so that they better secure the cable.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/clamps4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/clamps4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The double clamps must all face the direction shown to match the position of the cable and PTFE tube on the tool.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/clamps5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/clamps5.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Final assembly</h4>
        <p>Feed the cable and sheathing into the TPU clamps one at a time until you reach the tool end. Also feed in the PTFE tube into the double clamps and connect it to the coupler at the top of the tool. Plug the MX3.0 connector into the Birds' Nest and plug the flat spring clamp printed pieces into the orifices in the Birds' Nest mount. Pull the cable tight and add and tighten cable ties to hold it in place.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly3.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>There will be excess flat spring at the tool end by design. We will now trim it to the correct length to match our cable. Line up the flat spring with the printed part at the top of the tool and mark a spot that extends about 15mm further than the very tip of this printed piece. Cut the flat spring here. Note it is better to be conservative and have to cut more flat spring later than to cut too much initially and have it be too short.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly4.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly5.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Push the end of the flat spring into the printed part. It should point up vertically without any bends. Trm it slightly if it is too long.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/umbilicals/assembly6.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Rest the tool in the dock and space out the clamps evenly if you need to. Trim the PTFE tube shorter if desired, but only after checking the tool's nozzle will reach all four corners of the bed without strain. Repeat until all of your umbilical cables are complete.</p>

        <h2>Tool Coupling Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>This tab covers adding the coupling mechanism to each of the tools and the shuttle. This is the final physical piece of the puzzle in adding toolchanging capability.</p>
        <p>The relevant section of the video is here:</p>
        <iframe loading="lazy" width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_FhIQgqC2A?start=1782&end=2423" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>We now have everything in place to facilitate changing the active tool, apart from the actual coupling mechanism. This step will add this, as well as a TAP sensor which replaces the factory ABL probe. The TAP sensor will be used for homing, auto bed levelling and also lets the firmwre know which tool is attached. The parts have been adapted to suit the SV08 from those designed for the Voron 2 by DraftShift.</p>
        <p>After fitting the toolchanger mechanisms, the bed will be too low to reach. A set of spacers is needed to lift it up, with the front right spacer doubling as a mount to reposition the nozzle scrubber.</p>

        <h4>Factory tools disassembly</h4>
        <p>The SV08 tools have some parts we need to remove in preparation.</p>
        <p>Pull the plastic extruder wheel off the back of the stepper motor.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/removal1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/removal1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Unbolt and remove the rear part cooling fan. You will need to cut a cable tie to release the cable so it can be unplugged. Set this fan aside as we will reuse some of the wiring.</p>

        <h4>Printed Parts Preparation</h4>
        <p>Remove the support material from the shuttle.</p>
        <p>Four heat sets are required per backplate, melted into the flat side. If using the cowl locks, each receives a heat set too.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/heatsets2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/heatsets2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/heatsets1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/heatsets1.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Backplate assembly</h4>
        <p>Insert two M3 x 6mm coutersunk bolts into the angled surfaces of each backplate. Test that the magnets are attracted to your chosen bolts.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/backplate1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/backplate1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Insert M3 x 12mm bolts from above to meet the dowel pins from below. Tighten the bolts to pull the dowel pins the whole way in. The low, centre pin is harder to access. I recommend inserting the bolt the whole way in, screwing on the dowel pin by hand, then using an allen key to torque the bolt up and pull the pin the rest of the way in. The centre dowel pin will protrude further than the outer dowel pins when all are in place.</p>

        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/backplate4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/backplate4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Glue in a magnet in the underside bore of the backplate. Take not of whether you have the north or south pole facing outwards. Repeat for all of the backplates.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/backplate5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/backplate5.jpg" /></a>

        <h4>Shuttle assembly</h4>
        <p>Insert two M3 x 40mm bolts into the bores of the shuttle. These are simply to strength and are optional but recommended.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/shuttle1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/shuttle1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Test a spare dowel pin with some bushings to find three bushings that are burr free and smooth. This is essential for reliable toolchanging. Once you have three good bushings, press them flush into the hexagonal cut outs in the shuttle.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/shuttle2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/shuttle2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/shuttle3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/shuttle3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Glue three magnets into the bores on the shuttle. It is imperitive that they orientation be correct to attract (not repel) the magnet already in the backplates. Test this to avoid disappointment.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/shuttle4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/shuttle4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Test the engagement of the shuttle with each of the backplates. The pins and bushings should be aligned and interact smoothly. If there are any sticky points, try and adjust the bushings until they are gone.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/shuttle5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/shuttle5.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Insert the M3 square nuts into the openings in the back of the shuttle.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/shuttle6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/shuttle6.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Backplate installation</h4>
        <p>Position the backplate on the rear of the SV08 tool. The heat sets should line up with the holes in the SV08 injection molding. three of the holes are ready ti immediately receive an M3 x 12mm bolt. The fourth has the backplate leverage block added with the raised section locating downwards into the backplate cutout. An M3 x 12mm bolt with washer then secures this piece. You may need to temporarily unplug the umbilical cable for easier access to this bolt.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/assembly1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/assembly1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/assembly2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/assembly2.jpg" /></a>

        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/assembly4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/assembly4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Prepare the TAP sensor by using flush cutters to trim the soldered pins shorter. Mount the TAP sensor to the backplate with M3 x 6mm bolts and using washers as spacers. Ensure there is a visible gap between the underside of the TAP sensor and the extruder stepper motor.</p>

        <h4>TAP sensor wiring</h4>
        <p>Two useful resources exist that informed this step:</p>
        <p><a href="https://mellow.klipper.cn/en/docs/ProductDoc/ExtensionBoard/fly-tap/" target="_blank">Fly TAP docs</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Sovol3d/SV08/blob/main/Motherboard/Extra_PIN_definition.pdf" target="_blank">Sovol GitHub pin definition</a></p>
        <p>There are two options here:</p>
        <p>1. Make a new cable, 16cm long with a three pin JST ZH connector on one side and a three pin JST XH connector on the other. This would be the neatest solution, but I did not have a JST ZH connector kit (nor needed one before this project).</p>
        <p>2. Use a combination of the wires and connectors that came with the TAP sensor and the cable from the rear part cooling fans we previously removed. By soldering the two together we can make a cable fir for purpose without any additional expense.</p>
        <p>The following diagram shows the final configuration of the cable when made using option 2. If using option 1, the total length and pin order can still be referenced.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/wiring1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/wiring1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The following sequence describes how to prepare the cable using option 2.</p>
        <p>Take the red, black and white pre-crimped wires that came with the TAP sensor and insert them into a 3 pin JST XH housing. Cut the other end of the wires approximately 100mm from the plug.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/wiring2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/wiring2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Cut the rear part cooling fan approximately 70mm from the plug.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/wiring3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/wiring3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Strip back around 10mm of insulation fron the ends of both sets of wires. Overlap the exposed wires, then solder the together and insulated with heat shrink. Red to red, black to black, and white to yellow. The cable should end up approximately 160mm in length.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/wiring4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/wiring4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Use a thin pick to depin the red and black wires from the JST ZH housing and reinsert them in reverse.</p>
        <p class="warning">This step is extremely important to avoid damaging the S08 tool PCB and/or TAP sensor. Double check the finished plug with the diagram above.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/wiring5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/wiring5.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/wiring6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/wiring6.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Remove the four wire cable for the stepper motor from the gap in the injection moluded SV08 plate, then push the new TAP sensor cable into its place. The stepper motor cable should then fit back over the top.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/wiring7.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/wiring7.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/wiring8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/wiring8.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Cowl locks</h4>
        <p>Now is the time to install the optional cowl locks. A left and right pair is held to the blue injection moulded cowl with two #4 self tapping screws per side as shown.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/cowls1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/cowls1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Plug back in the part cooling fan and reinstall the cowl over the tool. Use two M3 x 10mm bolts to pull the cowl tight against the tool.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/cowls2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/cowls2.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Shuttle installation</h4>
        <p>Unbolt the factory black metal bracket from the linear bearing block. Unbolt the two belt grabbers and leave them on the bed without letting the belts move within them. You may choose to untension the belts before this step, but it is very possible to avoid this and therefore not need to retune the tension later.</p>

        <p>Install the printed shuttle over the bearing block (check the M3 square nuts have not fallen out) and secure it with four M3 x 12mm bolts.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/install4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/install4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Apply thread locker to the ends of four M13 x 12mm bolts. these will be used to install the belt grabbers onto the shuttle. Add the bolts to one side as loosely as possible, just a few threads engaged. Then install bolts on the other side, and tighten both sides until the grabbers are pulled the whole way towards the centre.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/install5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/install5.jpg" /></a>

        <p>If needed, retension the belts. Move the shuttle through its full range of motion and ensure the tabs on each side touch the injection moulded components. This is how the sensorless homing is triggered.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/install8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/install8.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Bed spacers and nozzle scrubber</h4>
        <p>The nozzle will no longer reach the bed when homing as the coupling mechanism moves it upwards. To combat this we have bed spacers that lift the bed 12mm but still don't cost any Z print volume.</p>
        <p>Take the magnetic sheet off the bed and undo the six M4 bolts holding the bed down. the heated bed wires will still be attached, take care not to tug on them.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/bed1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/bed1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Prepare the front right spacer with M3 three heat sets and then use three M3 x 6mm bolts to attach the nozzle scrubber piece. The old silicone nozzle scrubber is peeled off the factory mount and installed into the printed part.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/bed2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/bed2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/tools/bed3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/tools/bed3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Position the nozzle scrubber spacer at the front right and the five regular spacers in the remaining grooves under the bed. Lower the bed down carefully and secure it with six M4 x 50mm bolts. Reinstall the magnetic sheet.</p>

        <h2>Mainline Klipper and Toolchanger Plugin</h2>
        <p>This tab covers setting up the software and firmware side of the printer. During the build, these two components represented a lot of time, effort and troubleshooting. To allow those following this guide to avoid this duress, a pre-configured SD card image is available with the vast majority of the work done.</p>
        <p>The relevant section of the video is here:</p>
        <iframe loading="lazy" width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_FhIQgqC2A?start=2423&end=3294" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>These steps are essential. Sovol configured their hardware so that Klipper could not be updated, let alone upgraded to accommodate toolchanging functionality. Therefore we need to wipe the factory file system and install a 'vanilla'/mainline version of Klipper. Furthermore, we need the StealthChanger Klipper plugin to add toolchanger functionality, since Klipper does not have this by default.</p>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p class="warning">Before going any further, you must have completed the steps in the Preparation tab. If you have not collected the serial IDs of you various components, the following steps are going to be much harder.</p>
        <h4>Pre-prepared OS SD card image</h4>
        <p>These steps should be a lot easier than when I completed them because of the following resource. I have cloned my whole CB1 operating system to an SD card image you can burn to have almost everything set up and only equiring minor changes. Unless there is a hardware revision in future that breaks compability, this should be the most foolproof method of ensuring success for others.</p>
        <p><b>V1.0 - Initial release</b>: <a href="files/sv08/tools/klipper/sdcardv1.0.zip" target="_blank">SD card image</a></p>
        <p>Download and unzip the img file, ready for the relevant step.</p>
        <h4>Rappetor mainline Klipper for SV08</h4>
        <p>In part 3 of my build series, I followed the excellent instructions from the Rappetor team to convert the SV08 to 'vanilla'/mainline Klipper running from an SD card. Although many of the steps have already been completed on the SD card image, we do still need to loosely follow the guide.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Rappetor/Sovol-SV08-Mainline" target="_blank">Rappetor mainline Klipper for SV08 GitHub</a></p>
        <p>Please note that the written instructions on this site will always be more up to date than any video guide.</p>
        <h4>Step 0: Backing up Klipper configs (optional)</h4>
        <p>Step 0 sees us download a copy of the factory Sovol SV08 Klipper configs. Feel free to do this, but realistically you will never need this again.</p>
        <p>On the Mainsail 'Machine' tab, click the box to select all files and then click Download. A zip file will be downloaded containing all of the Klipper config files.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/backup.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/backup.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Step 1: Removing the eMMC storage module</h4>
        <p>The factory eMMC module holds the Sovol prepared OS. We can now remove it. I recommend keeping this as a backup.</p>
        <p>Power down the printer and access the underside. There are two bolts holding the module in place. Unscrew them and simply unplug the eMMC module.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/emmc1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/emmc1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/emmc2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/emmc2.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Step 2a: Flashing Media</h4>
        <p>Instead of downloading and flashing the img file linked from the Rappetor GitHub, we will now flash the img file from this page.</p>
        <p>Open Balena etcher and select the img file.</p>
        <p>Insert a 32GB micro SD card into your computer and select this as the target.</p>
        <p class="warning">If you select the wrong target drive you risk overwriting whatever was on that drive/device. This includes external hard drives, USB flash drives or SD cards. Please triple check you have the right target selected. As a safety precaution, you may wish to unplug all devices besides the target to make it fool proof.</p>
        <p>When ready, click Flash!</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/flash1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/flash1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>When the flashing is complete, Balena etcher will confirm success. If you are using a Windows computer, the Linux partition of the SD card will not be readable and Windows will give prompts to format the drive. DO NOT do this, just ignore the messages.</p>
        <p>The only thing you need to do is setup your wifi details. In the Boot partition, open the <b>system.cfg</b> file in Notepad++. Edit the wifi name and password. You may wish to uncomment and set the timezone too. Save the file and eject the SD card.</p>

        <h4>Rappetor steps 3, 4, 5 & 6</h4>
        <p>The Rappetor guide requires additional configuration work to take place, but this has already been completed for you. Therefore, you can skip steps 3, 4 5 and 6 on the Rappetor GitHub page.</p>
        <p>Step 6 asks you to backup the standard MCU firmware from the mainboard and tools. You may wish to do this but at this point it is unlikely you will ever return the printer back to its factory configuration. Rappetor also has backups saved on their website for you to access.</p>
        <h4>Step 2b: Booting and finishing Klipper configuration</h4>
        <p>We can now install the SD card into the mainboard and boot the printer. The touch screen's output will be upside down while it boots, this is normal. Once booted KlipperScreen should be displayed correctly. When the system is up and running, you will receive an expected error.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/config1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/config1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>This is because the SD card image has my serial IDs, not yours. The address to connect to the MCUs in Klipper in incorrect hence the above error.</p>
        <p>Revisit your document with your Klipper serial IDs and copy the address for <b>MCU</b> (mainboard). Open the file <b>printer.cfg</b> and paste in the address in place of the what is there.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/config2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/config2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/config3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/config3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Just above this is a series of <b>[include]</b> lines starting with <b>tool-AVR0.cfg</b>. By default only tool 0 has no <b>#</b> in front, meaning it is uncommented and active. Remove the hash to uncomment and make active as many tools as needed to match your build. For example, if you had four tools, uncomment <b>tool-AVR0.cfg</b> through to <b>tool-AVR3.cfg</b>. Once this is done, DO NOT click <i>Save and Restart</i>, instead click the save icon, then close.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/config4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/config4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Now we will copy the serial address for tool 0 from our text file, and paste it into the file <b>tool-AVR0.cfg</b> in place of the one already there. Again, save and then close without restarting.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/config5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/config5.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/config6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/config6.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Repeat copying and pasting serial IDs for tool1, tool2.. into tool-AVR1.cfg, tool-AVR2.cfg and so on until you have covered all of the tools in your build.</p>
        <p>Finally, copy the address for the Birds' Nest, and paste this into place in <b>nest.cfg</b>. This time you can Save and Restart.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/config7.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/config7.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/config8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/config8.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/config9.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/config9.jpg" /></a>
        <p>When the printer restarts, the Klipper OS should now recognise the Klipper MCUs, removing the previous error. However, since the date of the Klipper components is so different, you will likely have a new error: <a href="https://docs.mainsail.xyz/faq/klipper_errors/command-format-mismatch" target="_blank">Klipper MCU Protocol error</a>. We will fix this by the end of this tab.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/mcuerror.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/mcuerror.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Updating firmware components</h4>
        <p>On the Machine tab of Mainsail, scrolling down will likely reveal that the Update Manager shows some components out of date. Now is the time to fix this.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/update1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/update1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Click Update, then click through to the two links that explain what has updated and if any significant structural changes have ocurred. If satisfied, tick the confirmation box and run the update.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/update2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/update2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/update3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/update3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Repeat for all components.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/update4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/update4.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>'Dirty' Toolchanger component</h4>
        <p>During the original build, a small bug was found that prevented the printer from homing in some situations. With the help of DraftShift, I altered the offending file to restore functionality. At the time of publishing this file has not been updated in the Stealthchanger GitHub repo, so Mainsail will display the dirty label.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/dirty1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/dirty1.jpg" /></a>
        <p class="warning">DO NOT use the soft or hard recovery feature for this component. Doing so will revert the file back to stock and prevent the printer from homing. Just ignore the dirty label.</p>
        <p>In case you accidentally alter the file, the following are instructions for how to modify it again.</p>
        <p>SSH into the printer using the credentials higher up the page.</p>
        <p>Run the following command to move to the correct directory:</p>
        <pre>cd printer_data/config</pre>
        <p>Run the following command to open the file. You maybe prompted to enter the password again.</p>
        <pre>sudo nano toolchanger-homing.cfg</pre>
        <p>The Nano text editor will now open.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/dirty2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/dirty2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Use the keyboard arrows to find the line 11: <b>_TOOLCHANGER_HOMING_START {rawparams}</b>. Delete the <b> {rawparams}</b> text. It should look like this:</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/dirty3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/dirty3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Use the keyboard arrows to find the line 97: <b>_TOOLCHANGER_HOMING_END {rawparams}</b>. Delete the <b> {rawparams}</b> text. It should look like this:</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/dirty4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/dirty4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Press <b>Control + X</b> to exit, followed by <b>Y</b> to save changes. Finally, press <b>Enter</b> to save with the same file name.</p>
        <h4>Step 7: Flash Katapult bootloader</h4>
        <p>This step is technically optional but you woud be silly to not complete it. Not flashing a bootloader would mean that every time you wanted to update Klipper on the MCUs, you would need to connect the STM32 programmer to them one at a time. The Katapult bootloader being present means we simply run a script and all tools plus the mainboard are taken care of.</p>
        <p class="warning">From Rappetor: When connecting the ST-Link to the printer, make sure the printer is powered OFF. The MCU will be powered by the ST-Link.</p>
        <p>You will follow the Rappetor GitHub instructions for this stage, as they will be the most up to date. This will involve connecting via SSH (new login credentials further up the page) and copying and pasting commands to install Katapult, configure for our MCUs and then compiling the binary file.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/katapult1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/katapult1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>After this, we will use WinSCP to retreieve the <b>katapult.bin</b> file from the printer's OS file system. Open WinSCP, and enter the ip address of the printer then click Login.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/katapult2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/katapult2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Enter the same login credentials as when you connected via SSH.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/katapult3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/katapult3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The right half of the screen shows the file system for the 3D printer. Naviagte to <b>/home/biqu/katapult/out</b>, then click and drag the file <b>katapult.bin</b> to the left hand half of the screen to copy iy to your computer's file system. You can now move this file in Windows to a preferred location for the next step.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/katapult4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/katapult4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Power down the printer in preparation of connecting the programmer. We need to flash the katapult binary to the MCU in the mainboard and each one of our tools. The same katapult.bin file is used for each. Diagrams for the programmer connection are found on the Rappetor instructions under step 6. Use jumper cables to match the pin labels from the diagrams to those on your programmer.</p>

        <p>The STM32 programming software is also linked on the Rappetor GitHub under step 6. Since I was using a clone programmer, I had to use older STM32 ST-LINK Utility software option. Specific steps were required to get the programmer to work. These steps may or may not be necessary depending on your programmer, but this is what worked for me:</p>

        <h4>Step 8: Flash Klipper firmware on MCUs</h4>
        <p>We will once gain follow the instructions from the Rappetor GitHub.</p>
        <p>Turn on the printer and wait for it to boot.</p>
        <p>Follow the link to see instructions and the download for the <b>Automatic Script MCU update</b> file.</p>
        <p>Use WinSCP to transfer this file from your computer to <b>/home/biqu/klipper/</b> on the printer. If a version of the file is already in place, delete it and replace it with the freshly downloaded version. This will ensure you have the latest version.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/klipper1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/klipper1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The following steps can also be done via SSH. Right click and edit the new file.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/klipper/klipper2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/klipper/klipper2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Copy your mainboard serial ID, but only the portion after the underscore. Paste this in place of XXXXXXXX. The address should be surrounded by single inverted commas.</p>

        <p class="warning">When completing regular Klipper updates in future, only the following step is required. Everything up until now has been prep work.</p>
        <p>SSH into the printer and copy and paste the single line from the instructions. It is currently:</p>

        <h4>Stealthchanger Klipper Toolchanger plugin</h4>
        <p>Installing and preparing this <a href="https://github.com/DraftShift/klipper-toolchanger" target="_blank">plugin</a> took quite a lot of effort and troubleshooting during my build. the pre-prepared SD card image already has this installed and configured.

        <h2>Slicer setup</h2>
        <p>This tab covers importing a profile for OrcaSlicer that is setup for toolchanger functionality.</p>
        <p class="warning">This slicer profile has the technical aspects in place but has not been tuned for print quality. It is based on the inbuilt OrcaSlicer SV08 profile with minimal changes made to suit the toolchanging capability. Please use OrcaSlicer's inbuilt calibration tools to tune the profile for your filament and conditions.</p>

        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>Some of the changes made to the stock SV08 profile may seem obvious, like the addition of extra tools. However others may not be so obvious, like tweaking the start gcode to suit the macros on the printer, or adding a wireframe STL to the print preview so objects can be positioned away from the modular dock.</p>

        <h2>Calibration</h2>
        <p>This tab covers tuning and calibration of the printer now that all components are installed.</p>
        <p>The relevant section of the video is here:</p>
        <iframe loading="lazy" width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_FhIQgqC2A?start=3417" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>We now have everything in place to print, but every machine will have subtle differences, requiring some tuning and calibration. For example, the Z offset between my tools had variation, so there is no way your machine will be able to print properly with the Z offsets from my pre-prepared SD card image. Some aspects should already be close, such as the docking positions, and others may be close or way off. It is best to check and tune everything to be safe and thorough.</p>
        <h4>DraftShift StealthChanger wiki</h4>
        <p>We will be following the steps in the <a href="https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/wiki/Calibration" target="_blank">DraftShift StealthChanger calibration wiki</a>. The video will cover my steps, but always check with the wiki for anything that has been added or improved.</p>
        <h4>Nozzle alignment choices</h4>
        <p>The firmware works by assuming an gcode offset of 0, 0, 0 for tool 0, and then applying an offset relative to that tool for any other tools. There will always be small variations in the build of each tool, so measuring and saving the offets is vital. Multiple methods exist to achieve this as outlined on the wiki under<a href="https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/wiki/Calibration#xy-offset" target="_blank">XY offset</a>.</p>
        <p>I used the sexball probe as it is very easy and cheap to build, but also automates the process greatly. the instructions, BOM and printed parts to follow will assume you have taken the same path.</p>

        <h4>Selecting filament runout configuration</h4>
        <p>The SD card image config in each of the <b>too-AVRx.cfg</b> files has provision for the switch and/or encode functionality of the BTT SFS V2. By default, only the switch function is uncommented and enabled:</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/sfs1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/sfs1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>If you only wanted to run the encoder function, you would edit to look something like this:</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/sfs2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/sfs2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>If you only wanted to run the switch and encoder function, you would edit to look something like this:</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/sfs3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/sfs3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Check the pins in the config and make sure it matches how you have connected your sensors. By default, the pins in the config have been assigned to match this diagram:</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/spools/wiring5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/spools/wiring5.jpg" /></a>
        <p class="warning">I have only tested the printer with the sensors in switch mode. If you are using the motion/encoder function, you may need to refine the config after testing. The config in place is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/bigtreetech/smart-filament-detection-module/tree/master/V2.0/Manual" target="_blank">SFS manual</a>.</p>
        <h4>Physical adjustments</h4>
        <p>If any of the tools are not quite sitting right, you can turn the countersunk bolts in the backplate in or out to adjust the mated position. I didn't find this necessary.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/physical1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/physical1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The silicone cup that blocks the hot nozzle needs to be checked to see if it is sitting too high or low. If too high, the nozzle will collide into the side as the tool is parked. Tighten the bolt on the underside to lower it down. Loosen the bolt to lift the cup upwards.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/physical2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/physical2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/physical3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/physical3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The PTFE wiper at the front needs to be adjust so that the nozzle just scrapes it on parking and pickup. Two M3 bolts can be loosened to adjust the height, then tightened.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/physical4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/physical4.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/physical5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/physical5.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Homing and QGL</h4>
        <p>Now is probably a good time to do a basic home and quad gantry level to make sure everything is sound. Place tool 0 on the shuttle and use KlipperScreen to home the printer. You should see a message on the screen confirming AVR0 (tool 0 - the 1st tool) during the process.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/checks1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/checks1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/checks2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/checks2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Once homed, press the button for QGL and make sure the sequence completes without error. There is a delay at the start as the bed heats.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/checks3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/checks3.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/checks4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/checks4.jpg" /></a>
        <p>After this, manually place tool 1 (the 2nd tool) in the shuttle and home gain. Look for the AVR1 message confirmation. There is no need to run QGL again, but you should to confirm homing for every tool.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/checks5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/checks5.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/checks6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/checks6.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Tool Z offset calibration</h4>
        <p>Each tool needs to have its own calibration for Z offset. This can be time consuming but necessary. I primarily used the simple 'paper' method from the <a href="" target="_blank">Klipper docs</a>. Manually insert a tool, then home all. QGL if this has not been done in a while. The inbuilt <b>PROBE_CALIBRATE</b> command is excellent when paired with KlipperScreen for moving the nozzle until it touches the paper.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/zoffset1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/zoffset1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>When you are happy, save the value and retrieve it from the bottom of <b>printer.cfg</b>. Paste it into the <b>tool_probe z_offset</b> section in the relevant <b>tool-AVRx.cfg</b> file.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/zoffset2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/zoffset2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/zoffset3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/zoffset3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Repeat for all tools in your build.</p>
        <p>I would recommend a quick test print for each nozzle to see if the calculated Z offset is correct in practice. Time consuming but worthwhile to eliminate problems down the track. The example shown is just an imported cylinder primitive, widened in x and y, but flattened in z to 0.2mm.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/zoffset4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/zoffset4.jpg" /></a>
        <p class="warning">A reminder that Klipper numbers the tools from zero, but OrcaSlicer starts at one. Tool 0 in Klipper is the 1st tool in OrcaSlicer, and so on.</p>
        <h4>Other tuning</h4>
        <p>Although I already did this before cloning the SD card image, it is a good idea to tune PID for the bed heater and each tool heater, as well as input shaping for each tools. Manufacturing differences as well as differentces in print settings and hardware used for your build make this necessary.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html?h=pid#calibrate-pid-settings" target="_blank">Klipper PID tuning reference</a></p>
        <p>For PID tuning, manually fit the tool you want to calinrate, then home the machine to confirm it. Then run the <b>PID_CALIBRATE</b> to run the test. Paste the results into the relevant <b>tool-AVRx.cfg</b> file in the <b>[tool AVRx]</b> section.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.klipper3d.org/Measuring_Resonances.html" target="_blank">Klipper measuring resonance reference</a></p>
        <p>For input shaping, each SV08 tool has an accelerometer built in and configured in the firmware. Manually fit the tool you want to test, home the printer, and then run <b>SHAPER_CALIBRATE</b>. This will autotune for the current tool. Copy and paste the recommended input shaping parameters into the relevant <b>tool-AVRx.cfg</b> file in the <b>[extruderx]</b> section.</p>
        <h4>Dock Parking</h4>
        <p>Now we will test the positions for the dock in your build. the positions and sequence have painstakingly been tuned by myself with a lot of assistance and guidance from the DraftShift team, so hopefully they will require little to no tweaking.</p>
        <p>Manually fit tool 0, home the printer and run QGL.</p>
        <p>Run <b>T1</b> from the macros or type it into the Mainsail console. Hopefully, the printer will lift up and stow tool 0, followed by collecting tool 1 and returning to its original position just above the bed.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/tools1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/tools1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/tools2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/tools2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/tools3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/tools3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Repeat with <b>T2</b>, <b>T3</b>, etc until all of your tools have been tested.</p>
        <p>If there is a misalignment, the firmware will use the TAP sensor to detect the desired tool is missing and throw an error.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/tools4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/tools4.jpg" /></a>
        <h4>Dock parking troubleshooting</h4>
        <p>The first thing to check is that all of the tools are sitting properly on the dock. The rear of each backplate should be aligned, and the vertical height should be the same. Also check that the umbilicals are aligned and sitting nicely. If an umbilical is crooked or leaning, the tool will not sit straight in the dock and increase the chances of a pickup failure.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/tools5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/tools5.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/tools6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/tools6.jpg" /></a>
        <p>In each <b>tool-AVRx.cfg</b> file, in the <b>[tool AVRx]</b> section, you will find the <b>params_park_x</b>, <b>params_park_y</b> and <b>params_park_z</b> parameters.</p>
        <p>If the shuttle is not quite aligned with a tool in the x axis (side to side when facing the printer), reduce park_x to shift the pickup position to the left, or increase park_x to shift the pickup position to the right.</p>
        <p>If the shuttle is not coming far enough towards the front of the printer on pickup/dropoff, decrease park_y. If it moving too deep and ramming the tool into the dock, increase park_y.</p>
        <p>park_z should be the same for each tool assuming the entire dock is horizontally parallel. Increasing park_z will move the docking position up and decreasing will lower it.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/tools7.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/tools7.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Only make small changes to these parameters if you are tuning them. The changes will likely be fractions of a mm, rather than multiple mm.</p>
        <p>In <b>toolchanger.cfg</b>, we have <b>params_safe_y</b> and <b>params_close_y</b>. These are related to the amount of space given for dock clearance as the shuttle travels up to the dock for a tool change. It is unlikely you will need to change these.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/tools8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/tools8.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The most complicated parameters to tune are the docking paths. Many sequences are listed but the two that concern our SV08 build are <b>params_changer_sc_path</b> and <b>params_dock_modular_path</b>.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/tools9.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/tools9.jpg" /></a>
        <p>As the comment in the doc explains, these are complicated and shouldn't be tuned unless you know what you are doing. Some insight is available in the <a href="https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/wiki/Configuration#docking-path" target="_blank">StealthChanger wiki</a>. Unless you are confident, I would suggest seeking assistance in the <a href="https://discord.gg/draftshift" target="_blank">DraftShift Discord server</a>.</p>
        <p>If your toolchanging is working reliably and you would like to increase travel speed to reduce changing time, the <b>params_fast_speed</b> and <b>params_path_speed</b> parameters can be increased. Take care not to increase these to the point that the stepper motors skip steps as this will lead to some dramatic collisions with the dock.</p>
        <h4>Tool X/Y offset - Sexball probe</h4>
        <p>As discussed earlier on this tab, there are multiple options for performing X/Y tool alignment. These are listed on the <a href="https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/wiki/Calibration#xy-offset" target="_blank">StealthChanger wiki</a>. I chose the sexball probe and the instructions that follow pertain to that option. Follow the instructions from the wiki for any other options.</p>
        <p>After unboxing the probe components, test some of the shafts to find the one wit hthe least resistance. Some of mine had tiny burrs which caused the switch motion to be stiff. EIf necessary, remove any burrs until you have a smooth and reliable action.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/sexball1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/sexball1.jpg" /></a>
        <p>The mount top and bottom each receive four magnets, although you can reduce this to two per side if the attraction is too strong. The bottom mount has four bushing pressed into the hex holes, and the top mount has for dowel pins secured with M3 x 12mm bolts. A pair of M3 x 8mm bolts holds the sexball switch to the top mount, with the wiring port facing towards the opening of the 'Y'.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/sexball2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/sexball2.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/sexball3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/sexball3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>Remove the factory block which holds the nozzle scrubber and pressure probe. Retain the M3 bolts. Unplug the three pin connector going to the pressure probe.</p>

        <p>Use a multimeter to find the postive pin. This is the one which will read ~5V with the red multimeter probe touching it, and the black probe on one of the other pins. Use a pick to separate this wire from the housing and heat shrink it. We will not need this wire for the sexball.</p>

        <p> We will need the remaining two wires which are signal and ground. A use a pick to depin them from the factory JST connector housing and insert them into the two pin JST housig that came with the sexball switch. It does not matter which order they are used.</p>

        <p>Attach the bottom mount to the floor of the printer using the two factory M3 bolts. Magnetically attach the top mount with probe and test for an air gap under the base of the switch. If necessary, print and insert shim(s) between the switch and top mount to space it down. In the event that the bottom is the switch is pressed too hard into the bed, print a bottom shim to move it up.</p>
        <p>When the gap is gone, plug in the sexball to the cable we modified from the old pressure probe.</p>

        <p>When pressing and then releasing the probe, a confirmation message will be seen on the screen and in the console. If the message matches the physical action, you can comment the test section back out and restart the firmware. You can leave it uncommented and active, but it will clog the console output when the probe is actually in use.</p>

        <p>Tool 0 will head over to the probe and press on it from many different angles. Tool 1 will then be picked up and repeat the same probing. The firmware is calculating the fine differences in position between the reference tool 0, and the test tool 1. When the sequence is complete, the console will reveal the offset data for that tool. Copy the values into the relevant <b>tool-AVRx.cfg</b> file in the <b>[tool AVRx]</b> section.</p>

        <p>Save and restart the firmware. Repeat the process for the other tools. You can use <b>CALIBRATE ONE OFFSET</b> and enter a different tool, or use the <b>CALIBRATE ALL OFFSETS</b> macro instead.</p>

        <p class="warning">Please note the the offsets for tool 0 alwats remain as 0, 0, 0. This the reference tool that all other tools are measured against.</p>
        <h4>Customisation</h4>
        <p>You may wish to customise the printer, name, Mainsail UI, etc, a well as the KlipperScreen features too.</p>
        <h4>First print</h4>
        <p>I recommend a simple two tool/colour print to get started. The <a href="https://makertech-3d.dozuki.com/Guide/DSE+Only+-+Stage+12:+X-Y+Calibration+and+First+Print/44" target="_blank">DSE calibration model</a> is free and ideal for seeing if the tool offsets are correct.</p>
        <p>Import the two STLs into OrcaSlicer simultaneously, click Yes to confirm a multi part object, and assign the two segments to different tools.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/print1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/print1.jpg" /></a>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/print2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/print2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>While printing, if there are large blobs present on the model, you need to revisit the adjustment of the nozzle blocker and PTFE wiper from the top of this tab.</p>
        <a href="#" data-featherlight="img/sv08/calibration/print3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="thumb" src="img/sv08/calibration/print3.jpg" /></a>
        <p>When the print is complete, the two colours should be nicely aligned. There should be no gaps between the colours, no area where the colours overlap, and the Z height should be the matching for each. If not, consider retuning the X/Y offset for the tools that were used.</p>

        <h4>Print quality tuning</h4>
        <p>As mentioned on the slicer page, the profile provided is the standard SV08 OrcaSlicer profile with only technical changes made to enable toolchanging. Now is the time to tune for print quality. The built in OrcaSlicer tests for things like flow rate, pressure advance, temperature, retraction, etc will be of great use here.</p>
