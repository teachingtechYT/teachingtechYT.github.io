        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project is a collaboration between myself and the <a href="https://github.com/DraftShift/" target="_blank">DraftShift</a> team, creators of the <a href="https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger" target="_blank">Stealthchanger</a> modification for the Voron 2. This is built on the previous work of Viesturz in creating the <a href="https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger" target="_blank" >Tapchanger</a>, another toolchanger modification for the Voron 2. DraftShift contacted me and asked if I was interested in adapting their work to the Sovol SV08, a budget clone of the Voron 2. This has been a difficult journey, as I have never built a Voron 2 and therefore didn't understand the inner workings and processes, and the DraftShift team did not have access to an SV08. This was a true collaboration, and not possible with only one side. I am eternally grateful to the DraftShift crew for their patient support and assistance. Many times I was stuck and had silly questions which they always answered patiently. Thank you Chris, Justin, Thomas and all other contributors for their work.</p>
        <h2>Philosophy/Concept</h2>
        <p>The philosophy for this poroject was to provide a poath to convert the SV08 to a toolchanger in the simplest and cheapest way possible. Where possible, any modifications are reversible and systems have been designed to be modular. Therefore the steps are more or less the same if you are adding a second toolhead or enough to have six tools in total.</p>
        <p>There are numerous other options available for other variations of the modifications. There is nothing to stop you mixing and matching components. For example, use the modular spool holder from this project and print an alternate tool shroud from another project to better suit your needs. The simple approach and reliance on factory parts means there will be limitations. If these are an issue for you, feel free to upgrade as you see fit.</p>
        <h2>SV08 Max compatibility</h2>
        <p>I do not have acees to an SV08 Max, but presumably the design is scaled up using very similar parts. It seems likely that the parts from this project could be adapted to the SV08 Max or other Voron 2 variants without too much effort. Source CAD is available for all parts to faciliate this.</p>
        <h2>Discussion and Remixes</h2>
        <p>These instructions are hosted on this site to give the most control over the formating and presentation. However this platform is not well suited to discussion and sharing. Therefore, I have established a companion page on Printables found <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>. Please use it to add remixed parts or discuss problems and solutions with each other. Realistically, I will not be able to provide support for questions and queries. I aim to release my contribution with as much detail and flexibility as possible for others to understand it and modify it as needed.</p>
        <h2>BOM</h2>
        <p>Each tab has a breakdown of hardware, other components and printed parts. The CAD source is available for all parts and is linked accordingly. All printed parts have been oriented correctly and notes for materials/settings/supports are provided as needed.</p>
        <p>Please understand that prices and availability for components will change over time. Throughout this project I have kept track of the expected cost for those building the Toolchanger at home. The accuracy of this will diminish over time but hopefully the concept will remain, ensuring these parts are a good combination between usable and affordable.</p>
        <p>The cost of someone building this project will be a lot less than the expenditure outlayed by myself and the DraftShift team. Development requires experimentation and iteration that is hopefully not be present for the end user. To assist in covering costs, affiliate links may be used (and clearly marked) throughout each tab's BOM. Some of these are my own affiliate links and where possible I will maintain existing affiliate links from the DraftShift GitHub.</p>
